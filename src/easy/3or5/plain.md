# Plain English Solution

In order for a number to be a multiple of 3 or 5 we can devide it with 3 or 5 and check if the remainder is 0. So we can loop through all numbers from 0 to 1000, check every number and if the above condition is true we will add it to a variable, so that we can sum all those numbers.
